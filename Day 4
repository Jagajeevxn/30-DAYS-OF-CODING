Fever
Chef is not feeling well today. He measured his body temperature using a thermometer and it came out to be X °F.

A person is said to have fever if his body temperature is strictly greater than 98 °F.

Determine if Chef has fever or not.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);

    while (t--) {
        int x;
        scanf("%d", &x);

        if (x > 98)            printf("YES\n");
        else
            printf("NO\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

Bus Seat Numbering
There is a bus with 30 seats. The seats are numbered from 1 to 30, and the numbering is as depicted in this image.


As can be seen in the image, the bus is divided into two decks - The Lower deck, and the Upper deck, with 15 seats each. And some of the seats come as Single and some as Double. For example, Seats 1 and 2 are Double, whereas Seat 11 is a Single.

You will be given a Seat number, and your job is to classify it as one of these 4 types:

Lower Single
Lower Double
Upper Single
Upper Double


include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);

    while (t--) {
        int x;
        scanf("%d", &x);

        if (x >= 1 && x <= 10)
            printf("Lower Double\n");
        else if (x >= 11 && x <= 15)
            printf("Lower Single\n");
        else if (x >= 16 && x <= 25)
            printf("Upper Double\n");
        else
            printf("Upper Single\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
