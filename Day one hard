PROBLEM:
IPL Ticket Rush
DAIICT college students want to attend an IPL match.

A total of N students from the college want to go while only M tickets are available for the match.

Determine how many students won't be able to book tickets

APPROACH:
SUBTRACT IF NUMBER OF TICKETS IS LESS THAN NUMBER OF STUDENTS

PROGRAM:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int T,N,M;
	scanf("%d",&T);
	for(int i=0;i<T;i++){
	    scanf("%d %d",&N,&M);
	    if(N>=M){
	        printf("%d\n",N-M);
	    }
	    else{
	        printf("0\n");
	    }
	}

}

Question:
Weights
Chef is playing with weights. He has an object weighing W units. He also has three weights each of X,Y, and Z units respectively. Help him determine whether he can measure the exact weight of the object with one or more of these weights.

If it is possible to measure the weight of object with one or more of these weights, print YES, otherwise print NO.

APPROACH:
JUST USED OR TO CHECK

Program:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int T,W,X,Y,Z;
	scanf("%d",&T);
	for (int i=0;i<T;i++){
	    scanf("%d %d %d %d",&W,&X,&Y,&Z);
	    if(W==X||W==Y||W==Z||W==X+Y||W==Y+Z||W==X+Z||W==X+Y+Z){
	        printf("YES\n");
	    }
	    else{
	        printf("NO\n");
	    }
	}

}
