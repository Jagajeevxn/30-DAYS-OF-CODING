Moderate Problem:
Count the Notebooks
You know that 1 kg of pulp can be used to make 1000 pages and 1 notebook consists of 100 pages.

Suppose a notebook factory receives N kg of pulp, how many notebooks can be made from that?

Solution:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int x,y;
	scanf("%d",&x);
	for(int i=0;i<x;i++){
	    scanf("%d",&y);
	    printf("%d\n",y*10);
	    
	}
}

Easy problem:
Waiting Time
Chef is eagerly waiting for a piece of information. His secret agent told him that this information would be revealed to him after K weeks.
X days have already passed and Chef is getting restless now. Find the number of remaining days Chef has to wait for, to get the information.

It is guaranteed that the information has not been revealed to the Chef yet.

Solution:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int x,y,z;
	scanf("%d",&x);
	for(int i=0;i<x;i++){
	    scanf("%d%d",&y,&z);
	    y=y*7;
	    printf("%d\n",y-z);
	    
	}

}
