Problem:
Get Subscription
Chef wants to conduct a lecture for which he needs to set up an online meeting of exactly X minutes.

The meeting platform supports a meeting of maximum 30 minutes without subscription and a meeting of unlimited duration with subscription.

Determine whether Chef needs to take a subscription or not for setting up the meet.

Code:
include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int T,W,X,Y,Z;
	scanf("%d",&T);
	for (int i=0;i<T;i++){
	    scanf("%d %d %d %d",&W,&X,&Y,&Z);
	    if(W==X||W==Y||W==Z||W==X+Y||W==Y+Z||W==X+Z||W==X+Y+Z){
	        printf("YES\n");
	    }
	    else{
	        printf("NO\n");
	    }
	}

}
